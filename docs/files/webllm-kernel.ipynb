        "The `WebLLM Chat` kernel (be sure it is selected in the kernel picker above) is derived from a JupyterLite kernel implemented by [Aleksandar Sekulovski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandar-s-486829128/) at https://github.com/aleks-s10/agent-client-kernel/tree/main/lite-kernel.  This version currently lives at https://github.com/wiki3-ai/built-in-ai-webllm-kernel with Python installer by [Jim White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamespaulwhite/) and Copilot.  It will be moving to its own repo RSN.\n",

            "Building a skyscraper out of straw is a fascinating concept, but it's important to understand that it's not a practical or achievable task in its entirety. Straw is a great material with some interesting properties, but it has limitations that make a skyscraper impossible to build with only straw. \n",

            "\n",
            "* **Structural Integrity:** Straw is fragile and not strong enough to support the immense weight of a skyscraper. It can easily collapse under pressure. \n",
            "* **Fire Safety:** Straw is highly flammable and would be a significant fire hazard. Fire safety measures are essential for skyscrapers, and straw wouldn't provide adequate protection. \n",
            "* **Building Codes:** Straw buildings would likely not meet modern building codes due to structural safety and fire safety requirements. \n",
            "* **Scalability:** The sheer scale of a skyscraper is difficult to achieve with straw alone.  Straw bales are typically used for smaller structures like shelters or temporary housing. \n",
            "* **Cost:** Building a skyscraper with straw would be incredibly expensive, considering the amount of straw needed and the complexity of construction. \n",
            "\n",
            "**However, straw building is still a viable option for smaller structures:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Straw bale construction** utilizes a more robust form of straw, woven together with a mixture of clay, straw, and mud to create stronger, more durable walls. \n",
            "* **Modern techniques:** Architects and engineers are constantly innovating with straw bale construction, finding ways to incorporate it into modern designs and enhance its capabilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Instead of building a skyscraper from scratch, you could:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Learn about straw bale building:**  Explore books, online resources, and local workshops to learn more about the techniques and materials involved.\n",
            "* **Model a straw bale structure:** Experiment with smaller-scale projects like a model house or a straw bale planter box to gain hands-on experience.\n",
            "* **Explore straw bale architecture:** Find architects and designers who are incorporating straw bale construction into their projects. \n",

With advancements in technology and innovation, straw could play a more significant role in building the future of architecture. \n"
