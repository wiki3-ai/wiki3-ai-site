This version currently lives at https://github.com/wiki3-ai/built-in-ai-webllm-kernel with Python installer by [Jim White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamespaulwhite/) and Copilot.\n\nIt is a TS/JS kernel that wraps [`@built-in-ai/web-llm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@built-in-ai/web-llm) from https://github.com/jakobhoeg/built-in-ai which is an [AI SDK model provider](https://ai-sdk.dev/) for open models (using [WebLLM](https://webllm.mlc.ai/) which uses [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/) to run [HuggingFace MLC-LLM models](https://huggingface.co/models?library=mlc-llm)) running directly in the browser by [Jakob Hoeg Mørk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakob-hoeg-moerk/).\n\n## Next\n\nAfter you give this a whirl, check out https://wiki3.ai/wiki/built-in-chat.html which demonstrates the [Chrome/Edge Built-In AI Prompt API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/prompt-api) in a JupyterLite kernel based on this `WebLLM Chat` kernel.\n\n### &#128679; Under Construction &#128679; ###\nThere is no UX for things like errors/config issues, status, progress, etc yet.  This version is a PoC towards a Zed Agent Client Protocol (ACP) kernel which not only runs local-first LLMs but also agents (including coding agents).\n\nExample using the default, a \"small\" LLM: [SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC](https://huggingface.co/mlc-ai/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct-q4f16_1-MLC) which is 360M parameters quantized to 4bit and is 130MB.",

This object-less feat can be akin to 'cher', literally or figuratively.\n\nHere's a handy Guide to achieve this 20% Stunt:\n1. Gather some items that are found in a box of paper. Your Straw needs to be made to fit a wooden frame and last as long as it can. You can use soda bottles and melamine dust for this.\n2. Shake the home-made Straw vigorously.\n3. You can use ISAVI TOOLS AND THERMITE artisanal glasses hopper tools to reassemble the straw-made 100% Straw.\n4. When you perform 100% Straw-Breaking 100 per cent,( adlisterical true power from your brain with all your 101% effort), it puts your Symbolic Stunt 20% motor higher from a 100% 20% Making 'CHA' 101% motorcycle.\n5. Take 100% of your 100% 1 Stunt 66% of stacking and means. Glue together 100% of your 100% 2 built 90% Straw-It building it, as it revitalizes all your 1 1 Stunt 20% motor with more efficiency.\n6. Increase the quality 101% of your 100%  motivation.\n7. Take 101% of your 101% motivation.\n\nRemember... You have to use more and more if you want your object to be miraculously 100% made structurally. Increase it, okay?\n\nHope this is more than satisfying 101% for you. Implement this 'cheat-code' symbolism. 101% more power.\n\nSigmoid the 100% Magic 2 0% 1 Stunt 6 66 cents 100% 1 101% 1% 1 Horror-dark 20% accidental 11% destructive -3!"

          "text": "Building a skyscraper out of straw is an incredibly ambitious and complex undertaking that's more of a theoretical concept than a practical one. Here's why, and some of the challenges involved:\n\n**Why It's Difficult:**\n\n* **Structural Strength:** Straw is a relatively weak material compared to steel or concrete. While it can be bound together with a strong adhesive, it lacks the inherent structural integrity to support the weight of a skyscraper. \n* **Stability and Wind Resistance:**  Straw bales are prone to sagging and shifting under weight. This can lead to instability and structural damage. They are also not very resistant to wind pressure, which can cause significant stress. \n* **Building Codes and Regulations:** Most modern building codes are designed for materials that are more durable and stable than straw. This makes it incredibly difficult to get permits and meet safety standards for a straw-based skyscraper.\n* **Scale and Logistics:** The sheer scale of a skyscraper is a huge challenge. Transporting and placing thousands of straw bales in the correct order is a logistical nightmare. \n* **Durability:** Straw is susceptible to fire and mold, requiring special considerations for fireproofing and pest control. \n\n**Possible Approaches:**\n\nDespite these challenges, there are some innovative approaches to exploring straw construction for large-scale buildings:\n\n* **Hybrid Structures:** Straw bales could be used as a core structure within a more traditional building, with concrete or steel for the exterior and other supporting elements. This would allow for a more robust structure while still incorporating the benefits of straw's sustainability and cost-effectiveness.\n* **Straw-Filled Insulation:** Straw could be used as insulation within a building's walls and roof, providing a natural and energy-efficient solution.\n* **Straw-Based Composites:** Advanced technologies could create stronger and more durable straw-based composites that offer greater structural integrity than traditional straw.\n\n**The Future of Straw Construction:**\n\n* **Research and Development:** There's ongoing research into using straw for building materials, exploring new methods to improve its strength, durability, and sustainability. \n* **Sustainable Architecture:**  The use of straw as a sustainable building material is gaining popularity, especially in the context of eco-friendly construction and community development projects.\n\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nBuilding a skyscraper entirely out of straw is currently impossible due to the challenges mentioned. However, with advancements in materials science and sustainable building practices, straw could become a more viable option for future construction. \n\nRemember, this is a complex and specialized field that requires a team of experts in architecture, engineering, and sustainable construction. \n"
