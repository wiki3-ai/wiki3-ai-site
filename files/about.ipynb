This is a large undertaking and for there to be an alternative to proprietary solutions behind corporate moats, the rest of us need to work collectively to build this [Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) for verifable and trustworthy AI.\n* Wiki3.ai is a work-in-progress towards a fully-functional PoC.\n\n## \"Three Clicks\" to Use, Edit/Run, and Publish\n\nOur priorities are on immediate access and ease of use from the very first visit.\n\n* One click to useful information.  Clicking on a link to a [Wiki3.ai](https://wiki3.ai/) page should land you in a useful experience.\n* A second click to edit.  If you're on a Wiki3.ai page then you can change it by clicking once again.  The source content and the tools to run, edit, verify, save, and download run in your browser.  That includes running the LLMs and agents that process the data and generate content.\n* And a third click to publish.  If you want to contribute your content to Wiki3.ai or anywhere else, you can do so with just another click.  Of course if you want to control how it is stored and syndicated in ways other than Wiki3.ai's defaults, then that takes some minimal steps for connecting to the service of your choice in the usual fasion.\n\n## Means\n\n[Wiki3.ai](https://wiki3.ai/) is a [WikiWikiWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWikiWeb) site like that created by Ward Cunninigham as the original at [wiki.c2.com](https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiWikiWeb).  Our primary form of content is as Jupyter notebooks which are then rendered to static HTML using W3C standards for Semantic Web annotations.  The notebooks have full support for plain text, Markdown, and code in many languages.  The JupyterLite platform is the editing and publishing environment.\n\n### [JupyterEverywhere](https://JupyterEverywhere.org)\n\nA JupyterLite variant that already demonstrates the no fuss UX we want for Wiki3.ai is [JupyterEverywhere.org](https://JupyterEverywhere.org) at [https://JupyterEverywhere.org](https://JupyterEverywhere.org).  It is a rethemed and repackaged version of JupyterLite specifically designed to support computational education in K-12 environments.  Among other things that means local-first, no account creation required or expected, and one click publishing.\n\n## Source\n\nThe [Wiki3.ai](https://wiki3.ai/) site repo is currently on GitHub at [https://github.com/wiki3-ai/wiki3-ai-site](https://github.com/fovi-llc/wiki3-ai-site).  It includes a DevContainer and Dockerfile which enables it to be run with pretty much any Docker/OCI system, including a few clicks to being live on GitHub Codespaces.\n\nWhile the source is readily available, it is not necessary to run it to use Wiki3.ai.  The tools for using it are in your browser and served as a static web site.  No cloud services are required, until if and when you decide to publish on the web, and in which case you can choose whatever method works for you.\n\n## License\nThe [Wiki3.ai](https://wiki3.ai/) site itself is [AGPL v3](https://spdx.org/licenses/AGPL-3.0-or-later.html) but the libraries it uses are primarily BSD 3-clause, Apache v2, or MIT.  Of course the primary OS is Linux which is GPL v3.",
